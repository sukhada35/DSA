# DSA Practice Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains my practice code for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. I will be solving problems daily, covering various topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. This repository is intended to track my progress and serve as a resource for anyone interested in DSA in C++.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into several folders based on different data structures and algorithm topics:

- `Linear DS/`: Contains code related to linear data structures such as arrays, stacks, and queues.
- `Arrays/`: Specifically focused on array-based problems and solutions.
- `Queue/`: Solutions and implementations of different queue problems.
- `Stacks/`: Solutions and implementations of stack-based problems.
- Additional folders will be added as I progress through various topics.
